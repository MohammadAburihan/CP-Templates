# CP-Templates

Templates for competitive programming.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C++ templates designed to help competitive programmers quickly set up and solve common problem types. These templates aim to reduce the time spent on boilerplate code and allow you to focus on problem-solving.

## Features

- Fast I/O setup
- Common data structures (Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree, Union-Find, etc.)
- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- Number theory utilities (gcd, sieve, modular arithmetic)
- Miscellaneous helpers (debugging macros, custom comparators)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or copy individual template files as needed:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MohammadAburihan/CP-Templates.git
    ```
2. Copy and paste the desired template into your solution file.
